                Our journey began in 2008, when we decided to convert a distinctive farmer's cottage into a cosy venue for fine dining. Tilley's quickly gained a reputation for its balance of comforting classics (you must try our signature shephard's pie) and modern gastronomy. 

                Located in the heart of the English countryside, we pride ourselves on using only the finest ingredients in our cooking. As a result, our menu will change depending on season and on the availability of quality produce.
